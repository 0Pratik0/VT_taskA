SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

1.  Clone this repository or download the files.
2.  Open index.html in a web browser to view the card in action.

TECHNOLOGY CHOICES AND RATIONALE

1. HTML- used for providing basic structure of page.
2. CSS- used for visual design and animation of the card, making it responsive and visually engaging.
3. JavaScript- used to implement interactive functionality such as dragging and rotating cards.

KNOWN LIMITATIONS/ TRADE-OFFs

1. As the number of cards increases, the drag-and-drop functionality might become less smooth, especially if there are complex animations running on each card.
2. The current CSS layout and card sizes may not adapt to extremely small screen sizes or non-standard aspect ratios.
3. The current implementation might not be fully accessible, as it does not consider keyboard navigation and other accessibility features.

FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS

1. Add Keyboard Navigation
2. Infinite Looping of Cards
3. Mobile Optimizations
4. Improved Animation and Transition Effects
